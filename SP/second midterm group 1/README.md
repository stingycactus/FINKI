📝 TASK 1 — Even digits with recursion

Write a program that reads an integer n, followed by n whole numbers.
For each number, check whether all its digits are even, using a recursive function.

Print all such numbers starting from the last one to the first one.

Determine and print the position of the first and the last number (in the original order) that satisfies the condition.

✅ Test case
Input:
6
248 135 8046 222 579 680

Output:
680 222 8046 248
1,6

📝 TASK 2 — Text transformation

Write a program that reads an integer n, followed by n lines of text.
For each line, perform the following transformation using a function:

Remove all letters that belong to the top row of the keyboard:
q w e r t y u i o p (both lowercase and uppercase).

Replace every whitespace character with a dot .

After the transformation, print each modified line.

✅ Test case
Input:
1
Quiet people write code

Output:
.l..d.

📝 TASK 3 — Matrix column analysis

Write a program that reads a matrix of size n × m.
Using a separate function, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum element in each column.

Print the difference for every column.

Determine and print the index of the column that has the largest difference.

✅ Test case

Input:

3 4
1 5 9 2
4 3 0 7
6 8 2 1
